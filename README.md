Yes, a real NES game that will work on your NES

It's a little project to mess around with assembly 6502. Only the main character is ready + the first location is partly ready, but I'll keep working on it I guess.

Feel free to reuse the code for your needs - I did my best to make it as clean as possible this time.
The basic code for the game to launch properly is taken from Nerdy Nights NES ASM programming tutorial.
