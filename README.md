# -the-summoner
Yes, a real NES game that will work on your NES

It's a little project to mess around with assembly 6502.

Already implemented:
 - Character animation and movement
 - Passability of objects
 - Several locations (2 parts of the village and a cat house)
 - Animations of surroundings
 - Warping between locations
 - Map borders

To be implemented in the near future:
 - Interactions with objects, dialogs

The project is distributed under the teabag license. Feel free to reuse the code for your needs, but if it becomes handy to you for whatever reason and you somehow meet me in real life, make sure to buy me a cup of tea ~~or sit on my face if you are cute~~.

The basic code for the game to launch properly is taken from Nerdy Nights NES ASM programming tutorial.
